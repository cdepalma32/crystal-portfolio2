# Crystal DePalma – Portfolio (Built with V0 + Customized & Deployed via Vercel)

This is my personal portfolio site, designed to showcase my full-stack projects, technical skills, and AI-integrated development approach. Built using [V0.dev](https://v0.dev), I used AI-assisted component scaffolding and then customized the structure, content, and deployment independently.

The site is deployed on Vercel and connected to a custom domain. It's modular, mobile-optimized, and continuously evolving.
